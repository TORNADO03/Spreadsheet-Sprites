# A Pok√©mon Sprite library and Tradelist template

This repo's purpose is to provide sprites for the spreadsheet I use to catalog my dexes. You can find the spreadsheet right [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JOdD5FECYkZqWuLoc6vV1mhbBl_4AuvE/edit#gid=303381007).

## Credit
All sprites were taken from [PokeSprite](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite) by msikma.
